# 🧠 R Programming – Academic Repository

Welcome to the **R Programming Repository** maintained by **Prof. Anjit Raja R**, Department of Computer Science.  
This repository is designed exclusively for **academic learning and practical exploration** of the R programming language.

---

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository provides **purely program-based notes** covering **all 5 Units** of the R Programming syllabus.  
Each unit contains structured programs, outputs, and explanations to help students understand R concepts effectively.

## 🧩 Units Covered

| Unit | Title | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Unit I** | *Introduction to R* | Basics of R, Data Types, Vectors, Scalars, Declarations, Vectorized Operations |
| **Unit II** | *Control Structures & Functions* | Conditional Statements, Loops, Built-in Functions, User-defined Functions |
| **Unit III** | *Data Structures & File Handling* | Arrays, Lists, Matrices, Data Frames, Reading/Writing Files |
| **Unit IV** | *Classes and Objects in R* | S3 & S4 Classes, Object Management, Input/Output Operations |
| **Unit V** | *Modelling in R* | Statistical Modelling, Linear/Non-linear Models, Time Series, Clustering, Parallel R |

## 🚀 How to Use

You can access and run the programs in multiple environments:

### Option 1 – Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Change runtime to **R** (`Runtime → Change runtime type → R`).
3. Copy the code from any `.ipynb` notebook in this repository.
4. Execute cells to view results interactively.

### Option 2 – RStudio
1. Download the `.R` files or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anjitresearch/R-Programming.git

Open files in RStudio and run scripts directly.

🎯 Objectives

To provide a hands-on learning environment for R programming.

To enhance students’ understanding of statistical and data-driven programming.

To support academic projects and practical examinations.

To promote self-learning and exploration through open resources.

🧪 Sample Output

Each notebook includes sample outputs for better conceptual clarity.
Students are encouraged to modify inputs and explore variations.
